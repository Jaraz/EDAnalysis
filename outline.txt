Eurodollar Futures Convexity Analysis

Paper outline
1) What is futures convexity vs swaplets
2) How historically calc'd - perhaps tie to realized vol 
3) How it looks today vs 2014
4) Trading strategy
5) Risks/Follow Ups - OIS blowout?  Looks at OI per contract and compare to overall CoT

Graph Ideas
1) Volume / Open Interest - time?


Analysis Ideas
1) Correlation between zero rate + future contract
2) Open interest / Volume
3) Realized vol
4) implied vol? not sure how to get the data
5) margin increases?  prob not
6) curve steepness / level?
7) bid/offer spread



Email to Jabez:
1) More work on the trade execution side.  i want to show two things (but I also wanted to get you a first draft):
	a) Show some historical MTM gains on the long convexity bias trade, see what you Margin can make you.
	b) Show more on the Short Covnexity bias trade.  Variation Margin exposure, could look at the past.
2) What i'd add - but don't have access - implied vol / real 3pm swap rates / multiple years of convexity adj
3) Issues with my data
4) My OTC clearing margins are assumptions

Stuff to do:
1) CME/LCH basis wrt convexity
2) Why isn't it being arb'd
3) Look at ED options, i dont' have acces to good data on this from home

Further thoughts:
1) Gap exposure // Making clear you are very well delta hedged today, but its not perfect.
